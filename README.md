PROJECT : CSS-Animation-Drill

This project is part of my Becode training in Web Development. It consists of a Css Animation that I had to recreate as precisely as possible using HTML/CSS.

Motivation

The motivation behind this exercise is to evaluate the capacity of the apprentice to learn alone. How do we learn, react and progress when confronted to new materials? This learning process was made possible through the discovery of the CSS Animation and the keyframes feature.

Code Style

Css Animation and Keyframes. Code is quite (probably too long) but clearly structured with comments.
